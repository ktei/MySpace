UNIQUE FEATURES OF THIS THEME

This theme has a couple of unique features that we wanted to call out here. You should
be able to use the theme right out of the box and get a great experience, but if you 
know a couple of hints, you can use it to make an app that really pops!

COLOR THEMES

First, it's good to know that the theme comes in three different color schemes:
green (the default), orange and blue. You can enable/disable these by commenting
or uncommenting the right resources in Brushes.xaml. Notes in that file should
make it obvious how to do that.

COLOR ALTERNATES

In adittion to the themes, certain control have color alternates. You can use these
to emphasize a certain control or action in your application. The alternates are:

* DarkTextBox, DarkPasswordBox (a dark color TextBox and PasswordBox)
* GreenButton, BlueButton, OrangeButton (colored variations of the button)

BACKGROUND IMAGERY

To look it's best, the theme expects to be used on top of a dark background. We wanted
to have some texture in that background that we could only easily get using an image.
In order to tile that image, we created a control called TiledBackground. This is a
simple implementation of that concept and source for the control is included if you
need to make any modifications.

You use the control like this:

  <controls:TiledBackground SourceUri="Images/backgroundtexture.png" />

In addition to the background texture, we also include an overlay image that gives a
vignetting effect to the background. That image is called background shadow. To get
the right background, layer the shadow on the tiled texture like this:

  <Grid>
    <controls:TiledBackground SourceUri="Images/backgroundtexture.png" />
	<Image Source="/Images/backgroundshadow.png" Stretch="Fill" />
  </Grid>


FONTS AND TEXT

We designed this theme to very adaptive to fonts. In most cases, font properties are 
just inherited. Very few controls explicitly specify any font details. That said, this
theme is optimized and was tested with a certain set of font properties that you may
need to set yourself. The ideal font properties are:

    FontFamily="Trebuchet MS"
    FontSize="13.5"
    TextOptions.TextHintingMode="Animated"


That's it. We hope you like it!
